## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
 
I did not use any outside sources because I think the tutorial provided by CodepPath is straightforward to understand and easy to follow. 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

One challenge I encountered was I had no experience with HTML, so pairing tags was one of the many new things I learned throughout the process. For example, when I was designing the start/stop buttons, I included commands to pair each colored button with different tones, and I did not realize at the time that I would need to close the pair with </div>. Looking back, it made so much sense now, but I was confused at the moment and finally realized this mistake when I read through every line and put in the effort to debug myself before reaching for help, which is also a lesson I learned today. Sometimes we don't gain as much if we immediately turn for guidance in the face of trouble. This is why trial and error is such a critical mindset for programmers. 


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

After doing this activity, I found writing HTML, JavaScript, and CSS very fun because it is a totally different feeling when you know and see that you could create something functional and exciting compared to simply understanding concepts in textbooks. This is why I love doing hands-on activities. It challenges and expands my potential. Circling back to the question, I used to have a class that briefly mentioned HTML and PHP coding. I wondered how these different languages that I am not familiar with work with each other, what are their different functions/purpose, and how to distinguish the best tool depending on the givin scenario. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

One of my biggest mistakes and biggest blessing at the same time was seeing this oppertunity on the very last day when it's due. I saw the email from CodePath a little while ago talking about this SITE program. I was very interested and immediately made a note on my calendar to set a reminder for the due date. However, my grandma passed away recently, and she was the most important person in my life... Knowing she died alone from covid was devastating, so I pushed some things back to attend the funeral, including the preparation for this program. Luckily I saw the reminder this afternoon and started working immediately, hoping to get every possible chance and do my best not to regret anything. The biggest constraint was time, I had a data science final this afternoon, and only after then did I have the chance to start. 

If I had more time, I would want to add more visual features such as changing shapes and adding diagrams, paring reversed hints with reversed colors (ex. switching sound for green to sound for blue in later stages of the game), speeding up the clue to make the game more challenging, and also having a column on the side that shows "best records" to encourage people to break their limits. It would also be cool if the game were made not just on a web browser but also a downloadable app created by swift coding, which I learned on CodePath.
